# Annihilator Storyline: Workshop Notes

**Status:** Active brainstorming. Characters and opening structure taking shape.

## Premise

A saltburner crew discovers they've become outlaws in an instant. Their captain had been making illegal off-lane burns. Their ship's annihilator — designed to destroy rogue self-replicating mining drones — locks onto and destroys a crewed vessel in the shipping lane they were never supposed to be in.

The protagonist is a crew member who knew about the off-lane burns and said nothing. When the captain begins to implicate him in the aftermath, the protagonist kills the captain — an act the panicking crew reads as righteous leadership. He becomes captain on a foundation of murder and silence.

**The central lie:** The crew believes the protagonist killed the captain out of justice and decisive leadership. The audience knows he killed the captain to protect himself. Every scene afterward lives inside that gap.

## The Inciting Incident: The Annihilation Event

The off-lane burn put the ship in a populated shipping lane. The annihilator fires — possibly automated, possibly confirmed by a crew member who didn't understand what they were looking at, because in their proper lane there's nothing but drones. But in this lane, there's traffic.

The destroyed ship gets off a burst transmission before it dies. Distress call, black box dump, full telemetry snapshot — standard protocol. It names the ship that killed it. Their ship. Named, tagged, flagged.

**The cascade happens in seconds:**

- Comms light up with automated enforcement alerts. The ship is flagged in every system.
- The compliance officer's (ex-investigator's) console goes haywire first — annihilation events trigger full transparency protocols.
- Navigation logs unseal automatically. The off-lane burn coordinates are now visible to the entire crew.
- Every port, station, and lane authority has them marked.
- The crew watches in real time as their entire future closes like an airlock.

**Why this works:** Nobody has time to think. The truth comes through machine systems that don't lie and can't be spun. The captain never gets to control the room — the navigation logs are already on the wall, the engine burn records are public, the salt crust readings that should have been flagged months ago are just *there* for anyone to read.

In that chaos, the captain tries to spread blame. Maybe just "I wasn't the only one who—" and the protagonist kills him. Fast. Not dramatic. A tool to the head, something ugly and industrial. And the crew doesn't just accept it — they're grateful. Someone had to do something decisive. He's the one who stood up. Some of them wanted to do it themselves.

The protagonist becomes captain not through a vote or a power grab but through an act of violence everyone reads as justice — except the audience.

## The Crew

### The Salt Monkey (Engineer)

One of the maintenance techs who lives in the guts of the ship. Knows every pipe, every crack, every patch job. Can tell you exactly how many burns the ship has left before something catastrophic gives out.

**Mirror for the protagonist:** The salt monkey knew about the off-lane burns too. Not because anyone told them — because you can't hide illegal burns from the person who maintains the engine. The salt crust tells the story. The corrosion patterns are wrong. They've known for months and said nothing because it wasn't their call.

They and the protagonist share a guilt they never discuss. That unspoken bond is more complex than friendship — it's mutually assured destruction.

**During the killing:** The salt monkey watched it happen and knows exactly why. They saw the protagonist's eyes. Not rage, not righteousness — panic. But they say nothing, because the captain's death protects them both. Every conversation they have for the rest of the book carries that weight underneath.

### The Ex-Enforcement Investigator (Security/Compliance Officer)

A former investigator (STEA or equivalent) who used to chase annihilators and is now, through some catastrophic personal failure or disgrace, riding on one. Maybe the ship's contracted compliance officer — a posting that was already a joke given the captain's habits. Didn't know about the off-lane burns specifically, but should have. Their job was literally to prevent this.

**Mirror for the protagonist:** The protagonist's future. Someone who failed to act when it mattered and has been living with it ever since. Also the most dangerous person on the ship — knows exactly what enforcement will do when they catch them, knows exactly what evidence to look for.

**During the annihilation event:** Understands fastest what just happened. While the crew is still processing alarms, the investigator already knows: they're all criminals now. Every single one of them. Not just the captain, not just the people who knew — everyone aboard is accessory to an annihilation event. Enforcement doesn't distinguish. The ship is the legal entity.

**During the killing:** Doesn't stop it partly because they're already doing triage. The captain is a problem that just solved itself. But a trained investigator's reflex notes: *that was too fast.* People kill out of anger slowly. They monologue, they escalate. The protagonist didn't. He moved like someone closing a door before something could come through it. The investigator files that away. Doesn't act on it. Not yet. But it's a seed, and the audience knows it's growing.

### The Ship's Doctor

Official ship's doctor, but this isn't a high-end vessel, so his background is offbeat. A real doctor who lost his license planetside, or is running from something — malpractice, debt, a patient he lost. The merchant fleet doesn't check as carefully. Out here, medicine means contraband nanobots, pirated bioprinter code, and improvised treatments. He's a real doctor doing real medicine with fake tools.

**Mirror for the protagonist:** Someone who has always operated in moral grey areas but is honest about it. Knows he's operating outside the law. Doesn't dress it up as heroism. That quiet self-awareness is a constant, unspoken rebuke to the protagonist, who does the same thing but needs to believe he's the good guy.

**During the killing:** Has to deal with the body. That's his first act as a character in practical terms — examining, confirming death, handling disposal or storage. His medical eye might notice something: the angle, the force, the specificity of the strike. This wasn't frenzy. This was a single, targeted blow. The doctor may or may not draw conclusions, but the reader will.

### The Mushroom Wrangler (Waste-Plant/Life Support)

The ship's waste-plant keeper, tending the fungal colonies that keep everyone breathing and fed. Normally a quiet, respected, almost monastic role. This one is a true believer in the Stillness — sees the self-replicating mining drones that stopped replicating as a form of divine life, and extends that reverence to all interconnected biological systems, including their fungal gardens.

**Mirror for the protagonist:** The moral conscience of the ship, but an alien one. Doesn't care about human law or enforcement or guilt. Cares about systems, balance, the idea that everything is connected and every action propagates. Sees the protagonist not as a criminal or a hero, but as a node in a system that's out of balance. Says so in ways that are unsettling, funny, and occasionally profound.

### The True Believer

Someone on the ship — maybe a younger crew member, maybe someone the protagonist rescued during the mutiny — who genuinely, completely believes the protagonist is the man he's pretending to be. Their faith is total and unearned, and every time he sees it, it's a knife in his ribs.

This is the person whose eventual discovery of the truth will hurt the most. The audience will dread it from the first chapter.

Could be a separate character or a quality layered onto one of the above — the doctor who's cynical about everything except the protagonist, a young engineer's apprentice who followed him into the mutiny without hesitation.

### The Dead Captain (Absent Presence)

The captain the protagonist killed. What was his full story? How long had the off-lane burns been happening? What was his relationship with the protagonist before this? He's the version of the protagonist with twenty more years of compromise. Whether physically absent or haunting the story as memory, reputation, and loose end, he should loom.

## Opening Structure (Three Movements)

### Movement 1: The Annihilation Event
The ship fires on what the annihilator thinks is a rogue drone. It's not. The destroyed vessel's burst transmission goes out, and every automated system on the ship starts screaming. The crew watches their status change from lawful to outlaw in real time.

### Movement 2: The Confrontation
The crew turns on the captain. The navigation logs are already public — the transparency protocols unsealed everything. The captain tries to deflect, minimize, lie. He's already behind.

### Movement 3: The Killing
The captain, cornered, starts to point sideways — his eyes flick to the protagonist, maybe just "I wasn't the only one who—" and then he's dead. The crew reads it as justice. The protagonist becomes captain. The chapter ends with everyone waiting for him to say what they do next. And he does. Because he's good at this. Because the lie fits him like a glove.

## Twist to Develop

The ship that was destroyed had people on it — but it also had some very important cargo for some very bad people. Who those people are and what the cargo was: TBD.

This means the crew isn't just running from enforcement. Someone else is coming for them too, and that someone doesn't operate within any legal framework. The annihilation event didn't just make them outlaws — it made them a target.

---

## Open Questions

- What is the protagonist's role on the ship before the mutiny? First mate feels natural but almost too natural — is there something more interesting?
- How exactly does the annihilator's targeting work? Automated vs. semi-automated vs. crew-confirmed? Who (if anyone) pulled the trigger, and does that matter to the story?
- What happened to the people on the destroyed ship? How many died? Does the protagonist know, and does it matter narratively how specific that number is?
- The enforcement agency: existing doc uses "STEA" (Space Transit Enforcement Agency). Needs to be reconciled with the story's needs — do we keep that name or evolve it?
- The True Believer character: separate person or a quality layered onto an existing crew member?
- The destroyed ship's cargo and its owners: what and who? This is the next major thread to develop.
