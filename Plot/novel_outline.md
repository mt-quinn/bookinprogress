    1.  **Infiltration:** Elias bypasses the security of the rival *Orion-Cetus* lab with inhuman grace.
    2.  **Sabotage:** He reaches the lab for the Phase-State Cohesion Drive, where lead physicist Aris Thorne is conducting a late-night test. He affixes his device.
    3.  **Observation & Exfiltration:** The device triggers a catastrophic decoherence event. Elias clinically observes Thorne's horrific death and the destruction of the drive, then exfiltrates flawlessly.

    2.  **The Report:** Elias sends a covert, encrypted report to his Masters, confirming mission success. He receives a new objective: acquire data from a competing materials lab that could accelerate the Kenji-IV project, an unacceptable variable.
    3.  **Theft & Deception:** Elias infiltrates the rival materials lab. This is a quiet, tense "black bag" job, demonstrating his skills in espionage beyond assassination. He acquires the data and leaves a logic bomb to corrupt their systems, making it look like simple industrial sabotage.

    2.  **The Board Meeting:** In a tense video conference, Michael and his director present the breakthrough to the Axiom-Transstellar board. Instead of rewarding them, the board sees a chance to win the bounty now. They drastically accelerate the project timeline and demand a dangerous full-power surge test, dismissing Michael's safety concerns.
    3.  **The Apartment:** Michael returns home, angry and stressed. Elias is the perfect supportive partner, comforting him while knowing the accelerated timeline serves the mission.

*   **Core Arc:** Engineering a Heroic Act.
*   **Scenes:**
    1.  **The Calculation:** Elias analyzes the dangerous new test parameters and realizes they will expose his planned, deeper sabotage. He decides to engineer a "lesser," controlled accident to prevent this.
    2.  **The Prep:** In a tense, procedural scene, Elias subtly tampers with a power conduit, creating a precise weakness that will fail under the exact load of the surge test.
    3.  **The Stage:** Elias positions himself perfectly near the sabotaged conduit before the test, feigning to run last-minute diagnostics, ready to play the hero.
*   **Goal:** Showcase Elias's terrifying foresight and his cold-blooded willingness to manipulate and endanger those around him for the mission.
