# 📡 Communications & Governance

## 1. Neutrino Beacons (The Spine)

-   Colossal, expensive, **corporate/government-run infrastructure**.\
-   Carry secure, high-volume, lightspeed-limited comms.\
-   Reserved for planetary powers, SEFA, ORC, and major corporate
    stations.\
-   Heavily monitored; political choke points.\
-   People say they are "on-beacon" like we say "online."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Drone Mesh Networks (The Bloodstream)

-   Vast clouds of drones carrying data across the system.\
-   Can transmit **anywhere**, given enough time and patience.\
-   Messages propagate hop by hop, syncing when drones encounter each
    other.\
-   Used by everyday habitats, fringe groups, and syndicates.\
-   Slower and messier than beacon comms, but *universal* and outside
    strict control.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Mesh--Beacon Interplay

-   **Siphoning:** Drone networks pull "spillover" from beacon
    transmissions. Not the secure, encrypted traffic --- but public,
    commercial, cultural, and high-volume data.\
-   **Cultural Pride:** In mesh-heavy societies, being the **node that
    cracked and shared beacon data into the swarm** is a point of
    communal prestige.\
-   **Beacon Shadows:** Every beacon leaves a "shadow" of data in the
    drone mesh --- fractured, delayed, and incomplete, but enough to
    build an alternative picture of official information.\
-   **Pirate Net Effect:** Some entire cultures in the Fringe live on
    this shadow internet, distrustful of official channels, proud of
    their "secondhand sunlight."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Governance & Politics

-   **SEFA (Solar Enforcement & Flight Authority):** Controls torch
    lanes, but not habitats. Manages traffic law and accident
    investigations. Motto: *"Keep the Lanes Clear."*\
-   **ORC (Outer Resource Conglomerate):** Dominates patents for drones,
    life-support, habitat engineering. Controls survival tech,
    effectively taxing entire habitats.\
-   **Planetary Powers:**
    -   *Earth:* Fractured, bureaucratic, still massive but waning.\
    -   *Mars:* Growing independent, militarizing, defiant of ORC.\
    -   *Pluto & Charon:* Wealthy enclaves with a **space bridge through
        their Lagrange point**, controlling deep-system trade.\
    -   *Outer Moons:* Local councils, constantly juggling ORC debt and
        survival.\
-   **Fringe Syndicates:** Independent groups. Famous example: **Umbra
    Pact** --- altruistic protectors of their people, feared outside as
    terrorists, revered inside as guardians.\
-   **Tension:** Whoever controls beacons controls official truth.
    Whoever controls the mesh controls people's lived reality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Cultural Flavor

-   **Slang:**
    -   "Dark Time" → being stuck waiting for drone delivery.\
    -   "Shadowsurfing" → riding beacon shadow data in the mesh.\
    -   "Sunburnt" → caught using siphoned beacon data.\
    -   "Mulechained" → waiting on a relay of drones to complete a
        path.\
-   **Status:** Local mesh-keepers (who maintain drones and siphons) are
    as respected as priests or healers.\
-   **Identity:** People increasingly identify as "Beacon-born" or
    "Mesh-born." Whole hollows and bubbles call themselves **Shadow
    Nets** --- cultures that live entirely on beacon shadows and mesh
    chatter.

# 🌌 Thematic Weight

-   Neutrino beacons: fast, polished, surveilled, exclusive.\
-   Drone mesh: slow, messy, grassroots, resilient.\
-   The divide is a **digital class war** --- official vs. underground,
    fast vs. slow, polished vs. human.\
-   Power in the Solar Era belongs to those who can **seize, corrupt, or
    control comms.**
