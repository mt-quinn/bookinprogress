# 🍄 Fungal Systems of the Solar Era

## 1. Shipboard Fungus Growth

-   Mushrooms naturally creep across ship interiors, especially in older
    or poorly maintained habitats.\
-   Not catastrophic, but annoying: fruiting bodies sprout in ducts,
    storage bays, even crew bunks.\
-   Colonists joke that a ship's health can be measured by the "flavor"
    of its wild fungus --- earthy smell = fine, acrid = trouble.\
-   **Visual:** Bioluminescent caps glowing faintly along bulkheads,
    brushed aside like weeds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Fungal Waste Plants

-   Each ship maintains specialized, carefully isolated fungal colonies
    designed to process *specific* waste streams.\
-   Examples:
    -   One strain digests greywater and produces oxygen.\
    -   Another metabolizes nitrogenous waste into fertilizer.\
    -   A third processes hydrocarbons into bio-polymers.\
-   These plants require meticulous tending --- if colonies
    cross-contaminate, the whole loop can fail.\
-   **Cultural Detail:** Waste-plant keepers ("mushroom wranglers") are
    respected crew. They work in clean-suit vaults that feel like sacred
    gardens.

## 3. Mushroom-Derived Foods

-   Mushrooms are the **staple diet** of most spacefarers.\
-   Flavors, textures, and nutrients have been heavily gene-edited:
    -   Some strains taste like meat, others like fruit, cheese, or
        nuts.\
    -   A few can be dried into breadlike loaves or brewed into fungal
        beers.\
-   Colonies cultivate distinct "cuisines": one station might be known
    for savory black-cap stews, another for sweet golden-caps.\
-   **Divide:** Some spacers adore mushrooms, others loathe them --- a
    cultural identifier in itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Emergency Patching Fungus

-   Carried in sealed cartridges around ships.\
-   In the event of a hull breach, the fungus is sprayed or puffed into
    the vacuum.\
-   Reaction: spores instantly bloom into a foamy, fibrous mat that
    expands to fill the hole, then **dies and hardens into a brittle
    plug**.\
-   Only temporary --- must be reinforced or replaced with proper
    repairs.\
-   **Visual:** A puff of spore-dust, a rush of growth, a hissing plug
    sealing the breach as crew scramble.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cultural Resonance

-   Fungi are ubiquitous: part life-support, part food, part annoyance.\
-   Kids grow up identifying edible vs. waste fungi by sight.\
-   Old spacer proverb: *"If it smells like mushrooms, you're alive."*\
-   ORC propaganda quietly downplays fungal systems, pushing corporate
    protein vats instead --- but everyone knows mushrooms keep you
    breathing.
