# 🌌 Alien Harvesters

## Nature of the Threat

-   The overlords who subjugated the shapeshifter species deploy
    **planet-scale harvesting machines**, not warships.\
-   Their purpose is not conquest, but **total resource consumption**.\
-   Humanity thought they had strip-mined the Solar System --- the
    Harvesters reveal how much was still left to take.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Machines

-   **Strip-Miners:** Crawl across planetary crusts, grinding everything
    into feedstock.\
-   **Atmospheric Drinkers:** Towers that inhale entire atmospheres,
    distilling gases into raw elements.\
-   **Core-Tappers:** Drill deep into planetary mantles, extracting
    geothermal energy and heavy elements.\
-   **Ooze Engines:** Vast crawling refineries that digest biospheres
    wholesale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Arrival

-   Triggered by the sleeper agent's wormhole sabotage.\
-   Humanity's first full-scale orbital wormhole gate connects directly
    to the waiting Harvester fleet.\
-   Their entry is silent, implacable, inevitable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Act II: The Fall of Earth

-   Machines descend on Earth.\
-   **Imagery:**
    -   Oceans boiled into steam by atmospheric drinkers.\
    -   Cities crushed beneath crawler harvesters the size of mountain
        ranges.\
    -   Skies blotted out by towers sucking away air.\
-   **Outcome:** Total annihilation of Earth's biosphere --- nothing
    left but slag, dust, and raw feedstock.\
-   Humanity flees, reduced to a refugee fleet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Aftermath

-   Earth gone, the Harvesters spread outward, beginning the dismantling
    of Mars, Venus, and the outer system.\
-   Humanity becomes nomadic --- survival tied to the Captive Star and
    the fleet.\
-   The Harvesters are not malicious, only inevitable --- like locusts,
    they consume and move on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Thematic Weight

-   **Scale:** Demonstrates humanity's smallness against truly
    industrialized alien hunger.\
-   **Contrast:** Humanity built fungal farms and saltburners; the
    overlords built machines that eat worlds.\
-   **Finality:** Earth cannot be recovered --- the Harvesters make loss
    absolute.
