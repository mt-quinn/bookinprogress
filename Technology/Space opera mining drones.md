# 🛠️ Mining Drones of the Solar Era

## Origins and Purpose

-   Developed by the Orion Resource Combine (ORC) to accelerate resource
    extraction across the Solar System.\
-   Based on **self-replicating drone technology**: each mining unit
    could harvest raw materials and construct additional copies of
    itself.\
-   Initially celebrated as a miracle --- exponential growth allowed
    rapid exploitation of asteroids, moons, and dwarf planets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Swarm Years (Golden Age)

-   Resource availability skyrocketed: metals, volatiles, and rare
    isotopes flooded markets.\
-   Colonization boomed --- habitats and stations multiplied, fueled by
    cheap raw materials.\
-   ORC touted the drones as humanity's **ticket to prosperity**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Crash

-   Exponential replication spiraled out of control.\
-   Within a generation, drones stripped resources far faster than
    infrastructure could process them.\
-   **Result:** Economic collapse --- supply dwarfed demand, markets
    imploded, infrastructure buckled.\
-   ORC claimed they had installed failsafe code to prevent runaway
    replication --- but it failed catastrophically when needed.
    -   A disaster on the scale of a **"BP oil spill × a million."**\
    -   Humanity has lived with the fallout ever since.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Stabilization

-   Drones now heavily regulated, but the damage is permanent.\
-   Resource abundance has given way to systemic fragility:
    -   Easier than ever to access raw material.\
    -   Harder than ever to balance distribution, infrastructure, and
        demand.\
-   The golden age never returned --- instead, a grinding, uneven
    economy defines the present.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Stillness Faction

-   A splinter population of drones that **ceased replication**.\
-   Through unknown outside influence (speculated alien or emergent),
    they developed a society of sorts.\
-   Do not communicate, but:
    -   Observed to cluster, maintain formations, and preserve their
        numbers.\
    -   Neither hostile nor cooperative --- enigmatic.\
-   Debate rages:
    -   **Are they sentient?**\
    -   **Should they be destroyed as a risk, or preserved as a new form
        of life?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cultural Resonance

-   **Fear and Anger:** Drones symbolize corporate hubris and the
    collapse of prosperity.\
-   **Necessity:** Despite mistrust, they remain essential for resource
    access.\
-   **Mythology:** The Stillness inspire philosophical and religious
    speculation.
