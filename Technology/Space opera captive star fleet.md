# The Captive Star

## Origin

-   **Alien Legacy:** A gift from the sleeper agent after he breaks free
    of his overlords' domination.\
-   **Nature:** A stabilized **micro-fusion singularity** wrapped in a
    containment lattice --- neither star nor reactor, but something
    in-between.\
-   **Scale:** Roughly asteroid-sized, it burns eternally at a
    controlled output.\
-   **Symbolism:** Humanity lost its home star, but now carries a new
    one into the dark.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Properties

-   **Power Output:** Sufficient to sustain entire fleets with energy
    for habitats, agriculture, and propulsion.\
-   **Light & Heat:** Emits daylight-spectrum radiation --- not quite
    Sol, but close. Ships bask in its glow. Greenhouses flourish.\
-   **Mobility:** Can be "towed" with saltburner drives attached to its
    containment shell, or used as a gravity assist anchor for the
    fleet.\
-   **Stability:** Designed to last millennia. Requires alien
    calibration rituals that feel half-technical, half-sacred to human
    crews.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contribution to Torch Drives

-   **Energy for Refining Fuel:**
    -   Torch drives require deuterium, tritium, or uranium salts.\
    -   Mining provides raw feedstock, but refining isotopes is
        power-hungry.\
    -   The Captive Star provides limitless clean energy to process
        fuels, making torch travel sustainable indefinitely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The New Solar System

-   **Fleet Structure:** Humanity orbits the Captive Star in a swarm
    constellation, drifting together like planets around a sun.\
-   **Patterns:**
    -   Inner orbit: agriculture vessels and civilian ships.\
    -   Mid-orbit: industry and refinery craft.\
    -   Outer orbit: patrols and scavenger ships.\
-   **Aesthetic:** From a distance, the fleet resembles a glowing
    **mini-galaxy**, alive with torch fire and solar sails.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cultural Impact

-   **Ritual:** Ships align toward the Captive Star in regular cycles.
    New prayers and myths develop: *"We sail with our own dawn."*\
-   **Identity:** Humanity becomes the **Children of the Captive Sun**,
    bound together by its light.\
-   **Conflict:** Control of the star's positioning and power
    distribution sparks political and social tension.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative Hooks

-   **First Ignition:** A moment of awe --- the Captive Star ignites,
    blazing into existence. Humanity instinctively gathers around it,
    forming a reborn solar system.\
-   **Fragility:** Its containment lattice falters, threatening
    annihilation if not maintained.\
-   **Schisms:** Some factions worship it as divine, others fear it as
    alien corruption.\
-   **Visuals:** Refugee fleets silhouetted against a newborn dawn;
    hollowed asteroids turned to gardens; ships spiraling like comets
    back to orbit their sun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Thematic Weight

-   Humanity thought they were losing their star.\
-   Instead, they carry a new one: smaller, stranger, but *theirs*.\
-   Not a replica of Sol, but a **new natural pattern** --- a wandering,
    artificial solar system adrift in the void.\
-   At its heart: the alien agent, redeemed, who gave them fire.
