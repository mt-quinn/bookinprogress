# Saltburner Drive Worldbuilding Notes

## Core Concepts

-   **Setting:** \~150 years in the future, humans have colonized much
    of the Solar System but have not yet achieved FTL. Sublight nuclear
    saltwater rockets (NSWR) are the backbone of fast interplanetary
    travel.
-   **Tone:** Between *The Expanse* and Alastair Reynolds---hard science
    constraints, with awe and menace built into technology.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Drive Technology: Nuclear Saltwater Rocket (NSWR)

-   **Concept:** Uses uranium/plutonium salts dissolved in water as
    propellant. As solution leaves the ship, it goes critical and
    detonates in a continuous stream---creating thrust from a controlled
    nuclear chain reaction.
-   **Performance:**
    -   Enormous thrust and efficiency (Isp \~10,000+ seconds).
    -   Delta-v in the hundreds of km/s → Earth-Mars in \~2 weeks,
        Jupiter in \~1 month, Outer System in a season.
-   **Costs/Risks:**
    -   Radioactive exhaust plumes visible across the system.
    -   Any leak in containment is catastrophic.
    -   Ships must torch only in **designated lanes** away from
        population centers.
-   **Aesthetics:** Ships are traveling furnaces---massive shielding,
    crews living in tight "hab-blocks" away from the reactor. Visuals of
    bright blue-white nuclear fire lancing across space.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Torch Lanes

-   **Definition:** Safe, regulated corridors where saltburners can
    legally ignite torches.
-   **Features:**
    -   Entry/exit checkpoints.
    -   Beacons marking navigable "blue zones."
    -   Scheduled traffic, like railway time slots.
-   **Culture:**
    -   **Saltburners** (torch pilots) are respected professionals.
    -   **Annihilators** (illegal off-lane torchers) are feared and
        stigmatized.
    -   Off-lane burns tracked as "ghost trails" by enforcement drones.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Terminology

-   **Saltburners:** General term for any torch pilot. Neutral but proud
    working-class slang.
-   **Annihilators:** Captains who torch outside the lanes. Term carries
    strong legal and cultural weight, associated with recklessness and
    death.
-   **Slang/Proverbs:**
    -   "Torch true." (good luck)
    -   "Stay in the blue." (stay legal)
    -   "The salt remembers." (superstition: past burns leave marks).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Enforcement: Space Transit Enforcement Agency (STEA)

-   **Mandate:** Regulate torch lanes, license ships, monitor ignition,
    investigate off-lane burns.
-   **Tools:**
    -   Patrol drones shadowing lanes.
    -   Beacon webs to track ignition signatures.
    -   Pursuit cutters for chasing annihilators.
-   **Culture:** Seen as both traffic cops and essential protectors.
    Resented, but grudgingly respected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Investigator Deyna Vargo

-   **Background:** Grew up on her father's ship. He torched illegally,
    causing a mass death accident. He escaped but never recovered
    psychologically. She lost him to guilt and trauma.
-   **Perspective:**
    -   Compassionate, not bitter---understands why annihilators torch,
        but knows exactly why they are wrong.
    -   Preventative rather than punitive: she seeks to stop tragedy
        before it happens.
-   **Reputation:** Called *The Bloodhound* for her persistence. Knows
    how to read exhaust signatures and never loses a trail.
-   **Personality:** Calm, empathetic, but unshakable. Can connect even
    with outlaws, but never bends on safety.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Maintenance & Salt Issues

### Salt Crust Formation

-   **Appearance:** Huge crystalline sheets form on the bells after
    burns, like baked salt on fish---green-blue glow, brittle and sharp.
-   **Removal:** Crews in radiation suits crack them off with chisels,
    lasers, or robotic arms. Sheets fall with echoing clangs. Called
    **"shucking the torch."**
-   **Rituals:** Largest intact slabs kept as trophies. Missing crust
    can destabilize burns catastrophically.

### Corrosion

-   **Cause:** Hot salt exhaust chemically attacks metals.
-   **Effects:**
    -   Pitting, grooves, cracks in nozzles and pipes.
    -   Radiation embrittlement leaves hulls glowing faintly.
-   **Maintenance:** Crews constantly patch leaks and probe pipes. Outer
    hulls replaced like snakes shedding skin.
-   **Culture:** "Salt monkeys" (maintenance techs) say: *"The salt
    always wins. We just make it lose slower."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Narrative Hooks

-   Rogue annihilators torching outside lanes to evade law.
-   Saltburner shipyard scenes with crews shucking glowing salt slabs.
-   Vargo investigating a ghost trail across the Outer System.
-   Political struggles over lane closures or enforcement jurisdiction.
