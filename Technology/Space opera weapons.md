# ⚔️ Weapons of the Solar Era

## 🚀 Ship Weapons

### 1. Torch Exhaust Weapons ("Ashmakers")

-   Inefficient, suicidal, and more panic-inducing than tactically
    sound.\
-   Entire "torch-ram" ships exist, stripped down for speed and flame,
    flown by zealots.\
-   Rarely seen in battle... but when they appear, everyone runs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Relativistic Rods ("Godspears")

-   **Launch:** Magnetic flux drivers or full-hull coil accelerators;
    some pirate variants strap rods to disposable drones and slingshot
    them.\
-   **Ammo Tiers:**
    -   *Tungsten* → common, cheap, devastating.\
    -   *Osmium* → denser, rarer, wealthier factions field them.\
    -   *Depleted Uranium* → high military use, adds radiation poisoning
        to the impact zone.\
    -   *"Black Rods"* → experimental, ultra-dense exotic alloys;
        whispered about in black labs.\
-   A rod strike is essentially invisible until the victim *detonates.*

**Countermeasure:** Drone cloud Whipple shields --- sacrificial
interceptors thrown into the spear's path.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Pulse Lasers ("Crackers")

-   Terawatt bursts punching fists of plasma through armor.\
-   Victims don't melt; they **pop**, venting atmosphere in staccato
    cracks.\
-   Effective at ranges too long for beams, since pulses concentrate
    peak power.\
-   Nickname: "knuckle-poppers."

**Countermeasure:** Ablative ceramic sprays, reflective foils, and
disposable "mirror drone" curtains.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Drone Swarms ("Hivestorms")

-   Common form: **kinetic kamikazes** --- disposable drones launched en
    masse.\
-   Advanced: smart drones with mining cutters, plasma charges, or
    precision drills.\
-   Entire battlefields cloud with glittering motes of autonomous death.

**Countermeasure:** Counter-swarms, EMP mines, magnetic herders that
bunch drones for easier targeting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔫 Human Weapons

### 1. Needle Cloud Guns ("Mist Guns")

-   Fire clouds of micro-darts. Range and lethality scale with wealth:
    -   **Cheap:** Shoots BB-like swarms, lethal only in corridors
        against unarmored suits.\
    -   **Standard:** Flechette mists that pierce light armor, ruin
        suits, shred organs.\
    -   **Elite:** AP darts in live-computed formations --- micro-clouds
        adapt mid-flight, forming spirals or curtains that predict enemy
        motion.\
-   A firefight with high-end mist guns is like running into a **storm
    of razors that thinks.**

**Countermeasure:** Foam dispersers, ablative layers, spinning shields
that scatter darts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Scrapper Tools & Improvised Boarding Weapons

Blue-collar tools become iconic weapons of terror in boarding fights.
Some have evolved into purpose-built combat gear, blurring the line
between tool and weapon:\
- **Arc Cutters:** Miniaturized plasma torches that double as melee
weapons.\
- **Mag Hammers:** Electromagnetic sledgehammers used for shipbreaking
--- can cave in armored helmets with a single blow.\
- **Thermite Spears:** Disposable javelins tipped with thermite charges
that burn through bulkheads *or* people.\
- **Saw Gauntlets:** Rotary diamond-blade saws strapped to forearms;
cheap mercenary favorites.\
- **Spinebreakers:** Hydraulic pry-bars used to force hatches ---
horrifying in melee, snapping bones like sticks.

**Countermeasure:** Automated foam extinguishers, hardened boarding
corridors, drone sentries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Coilblades

-   Exotic monofilament blades accelerated with magnetic fields.\
-   Slice armor and bulkhead alike, but fragile, unstable, and infamous
    for accidents.\
-   In combat, they hum with a distinctive **keening sound** before
    cutting silently.\
-   Rare, terrifying, culturally tied to assassins and elite enforcers.

**Countermeasure:** Layered trap-armor designed to snap filaments,
electromagnetic mist disruptors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎨 Tone & Aesthetic

-   **Ship combat:** A nightmare of spear strikes and cracking pulses,
    swarms blotting out sensor feeds, Whipple shields glowing as they
    vaporize.\
-   **Human combat:** Blue-collar brutality --- welding torches,
    hammers, and saws turned against flesh and steel.\
-   **Class stratification:** Your weapons *say who you are* --- poor
    pirates with tungsten rods and BB sprayers, rich captains with
    osmium spears and AP mist storms.
